##! 28 February Fri

In the morning, I had to get an X-ray. I slept little after going to bed late at night and getting up by 9:30. It's kind of good to sleep less than usual but this requires catching up on sleep later during the day. Also if it's not something important, it's pretty much impossible to wake up if don't really have to. Sleep is absolute bliss and perfect happiness. Am I escaping reality? Only because of problems, so when I solve them I hope it'll be alright and I'll welcome each new day happily.

On the way back, was thinking about hot-module-reload, which I've been experimenting before. There are 2 sides: updating classes and updating functions. I focused on the second one &mdash; how can a function be dynamically updated in JS? The source code of the function needs to change, how can we do it? When the though "It's impossible" comes to head, it's a good indicator that you're doing it right. You're challenging yourself and even if it's impossible, you can find a workaround.

When I came back, I tried searching for dynamically changing a function, but the only way is to wrap it in another function which I don't want to do since when debugging with hot reload, this will result in an extra debugging step when stepping in, and it's not perfect experience. Also I want it to be implemented as natively as possible. But if changing the function is not a solution, we need to be changing imports/exports themselves.

After a bit of research, I got to understand that exports are binding: this means that when we export something, it's a reference to the exported object that is imported, and not an object itself. The best example is the following simple primitive export:

```js
// module.js
export let i = 4
export const up = () => { i++ }

// index.js
import { i, up } from './module.js'
console.log(i) // 4
up()
console.log(i) // 5
```

Here although we imported `i`, we actually imported a binding to it, and not the primitive value. When we update the value via the `up` method, its reference also changes. This wouldn't be the case in Node.JS, for example, when using CommonJS. I guess the use case is pretty rare, but it lays the basis for how the hot reload can be implemented: be can update the binding in the actual file, and every other file that imported and used it, will now have references to the new object. However, it's not possible to update `export const` bindings, because they are constants. So we'd also need to rename those `consts` into `lets` when transpiling code. It changes the nature of code, but enables hot reload, and it doesn't matter that much if it's a const or let, since we're using it for development purpose only.
