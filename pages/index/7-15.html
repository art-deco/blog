##! 7 March to 15 March

7th was a Saturday and I went out in the evening. The 8th was a Sunday and I had a hangover for being rude to the cloakroom attendant who kept telling me off for taking a coat out to smoke and at the end of the night I lost my ticket, had to pay so I got agitated with him as he distracted me from thinking about where I'm putting it.

On the 7th I found [this meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-bqiiRiDvk) "I am Not the Body, I am Not even the Mind" which is quite good. It's supposed to be repeated 2ce a day for 30+ days :P But by the end of that week it was clear that listening to all that positive "vortexy" stuff really made me feel better than anything for the last year. It's actually the only thing that works.

     On the 8th, I was in the living room watching TV and fell asleep with Guardians of the Galaxy on the background. Through sleep I could hear some conversation but my brain was generating some other dreams. It was like somebody needed a sphere, and at some point the sphere turns into a galactic vortex which is like a dot on a forehead of a Buddha who's sitting there mediating and whatever pain there is he can feel it too because it's all part of him. So I got the meaning of "Buddha consciousness", i.e. how we're all contained within that consciousness :)

Monday was spent recording a bit more videos to finish off the Youtube film. Tuesday editing, and so is Wednesday. Got really lazy with the blog and don't even know what's been happening whole week, but the main focus is that at first I wanted to fund raise for Irio as a product, but then I realised I needed to switch attention to Depack as a bundler, since it could reach more people and is just more logical. The hot reload that I was writing about thus isn't part of Idio, but of Depack, because front-end developers and designers wouldn't want to get into intricacies of setting up Idio server's middleware. Therefore it must be abstracted into a bundler, that is, `depack`.

Sunday the 15th was the most intense day when I was adding planned JSX features into Ã€LaMode, like class names into properties _etc_, and integrating Closure Stylesheets. A few bug fixes had to be done on the latter, like recursive `calc(calc())`, and `:not(.A.B)` syntax which for some reason was said to be outside of grammar.

*TODO*

- Simplify `calc` in calc in _Closure Stylesheets_.
- Provide a development server for _Closure Stylesheets_ so that Java doesn't have to be restarted again and again.
