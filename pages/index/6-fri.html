##! 6 March Fri

Slept long even though I went to bed at 3am, only woke up by 3.30 as well because of sleep debt from yesterday. I wanted to get access to the logs from ElasticSearch, but via Kibana, so the question was, how to setup _Kibana_. I used to have an older image with stripped dependencies, but for version 6, so I started working on updating to version 7, using the same method with `install-deps` that tries to start the server and listens for errors.
