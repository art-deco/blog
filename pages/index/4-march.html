##! 4 March Wed

Since I finished at 8 AM yesterday, today I woke up by 6 PM. Had to write a blog post and then was doing housekeeping. Had time enough to implement parsing of `<ul></ul>` blocks in Splendid, and fixing the video tag in the Idio website. Now this blog can catch up with proper dates, let's see if I can catch up with sleeping at night. There's no rest for the wicked maybe. There's no question about sleeping less but maybe waking up 6 AM and going sleep 8PM is better than the other way around.

Dot sucks replied to me on twitter with a like. Still thinking about that Open Source Sucks guess article if they let me publish it. The point I want to add there is that even if something sucks, it doesn't mean that we have to be very emotional about it, we can act responsibly and work together on fixing it. But sometimes people and brands just don't listen and want to get away with it, and look what happened to the Labour party in the UK last elections, because people thought they didn't listen. OK we can cooperate but the work is a competitive place. How to reconcile the two?
