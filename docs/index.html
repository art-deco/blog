            <h2>4 March Wed</h2>
            
            <p>Since I finished at 8 AM yesterday, today I woke up by 6 PM. Had to write a blog post and then was doing housekeeping. Had time enough to implement parsing of <span class="tm">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</span> blocks in Splendid, and fixing the video tag in the <em>Idio</em> website. Now this blog can catch up with proper dates, let's see if I can catch up with sleeping at night. There's no rest for the wicked maybe. There's no question about sleeping less but maybe waking up 6 AM and going sleep 8PM is better than the other way around.</p>
            
            <p>Dot sucks replied to me on twitter with a like. Still thinking about that Open Source Sucks guess article if they let me publish it. The point I want to add there is that even if something sucks, it doesn't mean that we have to be very emotional about it, we can act responsibly and work together on fixing it. But sometimes people and brands just don't listen and want to get away with it, and look what happened to the Labour party in the UK last elections, because people thought they didn't listen. OK we can cooperate but the work is a competitive place. How to reconcile the two?</p>

            <h2>3 March Tue</h2>
            
            <p>When will I ever wake up happy? Although I'm accepting it as reality of life to wake up with really heavy head, stressed out and thinking about all the same thing. I don't almost identify myself with it, it's because of stress hormones due to hunger and also it's because the thoughts and consciousness are so contrasted to the blissful happy sleep.</p>
            
            <p>Been working on the article the whole day. As I was saying yesterday, getting annoyed with stuff was just a way to express emotions it's not really that necessary in an informational post. When you're in that state you feel like it's important to say those words but people reading it won't necessarily be in the same frame of mind and because there's no usefulness of information and only some rambling, although meaningful, it can set readers against you.</p>
            
            <p>I realised that when I actually installed Webpack and it took about a minute to install, which wasn't that bad. I was portraying it as complete insanity but I always had quite warm feelings towards Webpack as I used it at work and it helped to build software. So I calmed down and started taking aggressive stuff out. One interesting thing is that I picked up that EMPHASISING points in capital letters from Kazchinski and the majority of times it was these things: you can expect RESPECT and feel like VALUED user, <em>etc</em>. Most of that had to go, but I left a few points about being a user vs being a developer, although gave praise to Webpack also, because it did solve the bundling problem.</p>
            
            <p>Created an animation for the article also and some graphics regarding scientific approach in programming. What I realise, it's not hard to actually be polite and respectful towards other people and there's no problem with that, I'm not an idiot. It's when certain others behave like total children yet they have no feedback as to their own behaviour and think they're correct while being extremely arrogant &mdash; this is the most annoying thing. But a responsible man can handle that?</p>

            <p>As usual, when not knowing how to do animation, a bit of anxiety and leaving the workplace for food/tea <em>etc</em>. But in the end, you're just, let's get on with it, and draw a line. I know I want it the prettiest very well designed line in the world, but let's just press <span class="tm">N</span> and draw the line / a circle. I wish I could draw properly, but we have to work with what there is.</p>
            
            <p>By the end of the day (or night, or start of the new day as it was 8 am), I was testing frontend middleware on photo-uploader, and it didn't work as I didn't write code in <em>Idio</em> to hook up the hot reload config properly. Also when overriding methods of the class's prototype, if it's a getter, it will actually be called:</p>
            
            <pre id="ccdbf2"><code class="javascript hljs">class A {
  get test() {
    console.log('hello')
    return 'test'
  }
}
A.prototype['test'] // -&gt; this calls getter and
                    // produces side effects
                    // such as console logging</code></pre>
            
            <p>Instead, I'll have to use <span class="tm">getOwnPropertyDescriptor</span> for updating prototypes. Moreover, I realised I have to not only update those methods that changed, but ALL methods of the prototype, because the code in the file might have changed that is referenced by the method, therefore even if its code didn't change, it might be calling a function that was updated.</p>
            
            <pre id="ccdbf"><code class="javascript hljs">class A {
  test() {
    return example('test')
  }
}

// this can change so the whole of prototype must change
// on updates, since we don't know which method used it
const example = (s) =&gt; {
  return s + '!'
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>Stack overflow is addictive AF. They're worse than facebook because you're generating quite a bit of interaction and you always want to go back to check responses / whether your answers were accepted. I don't like that it's triggering the part of the brain that's compulsive. Plus their badges... Visit on 600 consecutive days, keep getting 200 rep, etc. It's really annoying.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, when experimenting with hot-reload in React, I had to install it and try updates. It was good to understand how their, and Webpack's reload works in details. This type of information is much more useful for a blog post instead of talking about how we're all hostage to their technology. Abramov's reload does have disadvantages: when stepping into a method, you have to click multiple times to go through proxy. Same with Webpack's modules, you have to click "step in" thrice to end up in the function that you want. Therefore my reload is even better than these heavy solutions.</p>
            
            <p>Also a bound function won't be updated in React-hot-reload, since it was bound in the prototype, so we're equal here. One way to fix this, is to override the constructor method of a class which will only be called once, and apply a proxy to any function that is being bound. This should only need to be done for bound functions as all other times we can simply override the prototype.</p>

            <p>Working on the content for the website. In the morning, I started answering <em>StackOverflow</em> questions. I think a little bit of time in the morning is good for a warm up, and helping somebody is definitely a way to keep positive as it can really mean a difference to others who can benefit from your experience.</p>
            
            <p>Program-wise, I wanted to implement a gif-video component for www.idio.cc, so that a large 400kb can be converted into a movie automatically with ffmpeg, and lazy-loaded. Chrome lazy-loads videos by itself, but other browsers might not do it, so we first load a placeholder, and then a video on top of it when the component is scrolled into view.</p>

            <p>After doing this, I needed an API from <em>Splendid</em> to extract image width and height, which was implemented by but as a private function before, so I made it available. A few more bugs with paragraphs were fixed. The width of webp images isn't increasing above original width as was happening before, because the "sizes" attribute could include width even larger that the original image. Web components are now published in a separate package because they don't update as often as source code, yet are 500KB in size so each time I republished, it was taking up unnecessary space.</p>

            <p>I've been writing the article about pure hot reload. Went on talking about new "open source" vendor lock since webpack is now COMPULSORY, yet it's made of 350 dependencies which is mind-blowing under normal circumstances, but because of transvalued principle of software, it's absolutely ok and nobody is noticing. So I was a bit negative about it. For some tests, looked up <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/author/38027-Zoroaster">Zoroaster quotes</a>. It brought quite mixed feelings. On the one hand, he's about good thoughts / words/ deeds:</p>
            
            <blockquote class="b-r">
              Turn yourself not away from three best things: Good Thought, Good Word, and Good Deed.
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote class="b-r">
              Always meet petulance with gentleness and perverseness with kindness. A gentle hand can lead even en elephant by a hair. Reply to thine enemy with gentleness.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Which is good as it's making you operate from the rational part of the brain, rather than emotional and the one that's fighting for survival (hate, anger).</p>
            
            <p>On the other hand,</p>
            
            <blockquote class="b-r">
              War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery has saved the unfotunate.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="b-r">
              You shall love peace as a means to new wars - and the short peace more than the long.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I feel like those are not by Zoroaster actually, but from Nietzschean Zarathustra 😄 There's a lot of courage and war waging in Nietzsche, which seems to be opposite of peaceful Zoroaster, although I might not know enough about the latter. Still what I'm trying to figure out if it's OK to talk about things I don't like in a way that I want to, or not and I should be more chilled out about it.</p>
            
            <p>"When we are in doubt whether an action is good or bad, abstain from it." Zeus's mother taught him not to make enemies but friends instead. Tao is about helping others in a way that in the end they say, "we did it ourselves" and not making anyone upset as it's going to bring imbalance. On the other hand, it's all philology. Real world is rock-solid and if people weren't taking enough responsibility why they're not expecting to be told off? That's where right wing comes in, to be able to ask hard questions and express oneself in a way that is appropriate to the level of feelings that I have if they're justified. Have I taken enough responsibility?</p>

            <p>A lot of sleeping today. Listening to Zoroastrian prayers on iPhone, it's pretty chilled. One of the main principles of Tao is <span class="tm">Pu</span>: a Chinese word meaning "unworked wood". The mind is the one that discriminates while in reality things are unworked. But if I can just listen to beautiful Avestian while not getting my head stuffed with other shit prevalent in religion, others take it too seriously. This is to the point, if I like Avestian, don't others who are passionate about other stuff, deserve to listen to what they like? One thing is to just listen to some calming speech you don't understand, another one is to get stuck around fake concepts. But to each his own, isn't.</p>
            
            <p>Worked more on frontend and enabled hot reload for CSS and standard JS files. Integrated it into <em>Idio</em> with documentation. Moreover, <em>Idio</em> now also receives <em>JSON Body</em> middleware to parse incoming JSON requests easily. Started to make <span class="tm">idio</span> website. Found a bug on GitHub that prevents you from adding a WWW domain if you've set up an apex domain already (e.g., I had idio.cc so I couldn't set up www.idio.cc). The website doesn't work from Canada because cc domain doesn't get resolved which isn't great.</p>
            
            <p>Updated <em>Splendid</em> template for Idio, as well as made changes to <em>Splendid</em> itself to include closure-stylesheets as STDLIB. Fixed paragraphs extraction which wasn't forking properly before. An interesting point is that regexes are sticky, which prevents matching multiple consecutive paragraphs</p>
            
            <pre id="c1953"><code class="markdown hljs">We want to match

-- start

Paragraph 1: Hello world

Paragraph 2: Foo Bar

-- end</code></pre>
            
            <pre id="ccdbf1"><code class="javascript hljs">// regex to match this:
const regex = /\n\n[^\s&lt;][\s\S]+\n\n/</code></pre>
            
            <p>The regex makes sense, but because the first match will end with <span class="tm">\n\n</span>, they won't be included for the next match which means the paragraph won't be detected. The example is simplified, but it conveys the point. The work around is<span id="c06ef"></span></p>
            
            <p>To simply run the regex twice :) Because we don't want to match tags (<span class="tm">[^&lt;]</span>), the first pass will create a paragraph tag <span class="tm">&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</span>, but the second time it will remain unmatched, so that the next paragraph can be detected. It's good it's working properly now.</p>
